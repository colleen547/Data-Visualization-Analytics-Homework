# excel-challenge - Kickstart My Chart

<b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. In this case, a database of 4,000 past projects were organized and analyzed in order to uncover any hidden trends.

<b>DETAILS</b><br>
Using an Excel table, data from 4,000 past Kickstarter projects was modified and analyzed to uncover market trends.

Conditional formatting was used to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.

A new column O called Percent Funded was created to using a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.

Next conditional formatting was used to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. The scale starts a dark shade of red at 0 and transitions, to yellow at 100, and green at 200.

Then a new column P called Average Donation was created to use a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

Finally, two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, were created to use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.
